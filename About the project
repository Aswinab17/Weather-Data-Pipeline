This project is an end‑to‑end data engineering pipeline designed to process
historical, incremental, and real-time weather data from multiple stations.
The pipeline supports analytics, forecasting, and monitoring of extreme weather events.



Each component of my pipeline is designed as a separate job,
similar to real data engineering systems:
                  1.ingestion.py → batch load to Bronze
                  2.batch_etl_job.py → transformation & analytics → Silver
                  3.incremental_load_job.py → daily incremental updates
                  4.streaming_job.py → real-time processing and extreme weather detection
                  5.This modular design makes the pipeline flexible, reusable, and maintainable.
